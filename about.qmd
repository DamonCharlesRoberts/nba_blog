I am a HUGE fan of sports; primarily baseball, basketball, and cycling. I used to only like playing sports, but over the past few years I have become a major fan of watching it too.

Anyhow, I am extremely passionate about sports as well as data. So, I thought I'd merge those two loves and create a dedicated blog to it.
