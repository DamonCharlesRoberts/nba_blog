In fact, my wife and I are season ticket holders with the Denver Nuggets because that is our favorite date night.\nAnyhow, I am extremely passionate about Basketball as well as data. So, I thought I’d merge those two loves and create a dedicated blog to it."

    "text": "Jokić had an insane season in 2022. Despite that, he didn’t win the league MVP. Looking at the number of triple doubles that he had in 2022 relative to 2020 and 2021 – the two years he did win the league MVP, it was clear that he was on another level. For much of the 2022 season, his AVERAGE Points Per Game, Assists Per Game, and Rebounds Per Game was a triple double.\nWith the new NBA season starting up and Jokić looking to defend the Denver Nuggets’ title, I want to follow along throughout the season to see how that triple-double machine does this season.\nTo do this, I access the nba_api library in Python. I have a script that runs daily to update the dataset and the corresponding plot below so that I can check to see whether the Nuggets played that day and whether Jokić had a triple-double in that game.\nMore specifically, this blog post is part of a Quarto blog that I have publish through a Github action and updates through Netlify. Each day, I have a Github action re-run this document.\nLet’s see how Jokić is doing\n\n\n\n\n                                                \nFigure 1: Triple Double"
